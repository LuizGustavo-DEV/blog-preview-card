## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- CSS Grid (for demo purposes)
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

With this practice I managed to get a better grasp on the workflow of CUBE CSS.
With CUBE CSS, you first start by setting the stage through global styles: fonts, line heights, colors, spacing, etc.
Then you start styling base elements, such as the body, paragraphs and headings to take full advantage of the cascade.
After the initial styling you already have a good basis to start creating composition (layout) and utility (styling) classes THAT YOU WILL USE (important detail there).
When something more specific comes up, then it would be a good time to create blocks. And when a variation of said block exists, then exception classes can deal with them.

Overall, I feel that this is a great approach to writting concise CSS. Instead of a bunch of classes that do the same thing but with a different name, you have one class (or maybe none at all!) that do one thing and one thing only and can be reused everywhere.

### Continued development

I plan to continue perfecting my understanding of CUBE CSS by tackling bigger projects on Frontend Mentor.

### Useful resources

- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - An excellent resource to create fluid fonts, spacing and grids. I personally only used it for the font sizes.
- [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/NanhQvnvbR8?si=LJxMk21WlwIBYQ6m) - This specific video of Kevin Powell made me understand how to best utilize CUBE CSS.
